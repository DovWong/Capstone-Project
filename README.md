## Overview
This project use the e-commerce dataset from Kaggle to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), data visualization and develop simple Recommendation System.

In EDA, there are some descriptions of dataset and find the average view count and time before purchase. I use Tableau for data visualiation. It shows the activity level over weekday and hour in a day. In Recommendation System, I uses Content Based and Collaborative Filter Recommendation System.
